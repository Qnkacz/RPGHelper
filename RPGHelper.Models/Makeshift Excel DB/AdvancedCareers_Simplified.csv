Anointed Priest,"A priest who has consistently upheld the tenets of his church is chosen by his God to take on greater power and responsibility. Anointed Priests are gifted with the Divine Lore of the deity they serve and consequently, they’re expected to take on challenges suitable to their new blessings. They often have all the attributes that their God admires, acting as beacons of faith to others in the Old World. Anointed Priests are greatly trusted by the common folk, who will often listen to them over both Nobles and Politicians, granting them a great deal of temporal power to complement the spiritual.","15,15,10,10,10,15,25,20","1,2,0,0,0,2,0,0","Academic Knowledge (any two), Academic Knowledge (Theology), Channelling, Charm, Common Knowledge (any two), Gossip, Heal, Magical Sense, Ride or Swim, Speak Arcane Language (Magick), Speak Language (any two)","Aethyric Attunement or Meditation, Armoured Casting or Fast Hands, Divine Lore (any one), Lesser Magic (any two), Seasoned Traveller or Strike Mighty Blow",Priest,"Demagogue, Flagellant, High Priest, Scholar, Witch Hunter"
Artisan,"Artisans are skilled craftsmen and masters of their trades. Most commonly found in towns and cities, Artisans are organized into a bewildering variety of guilds. The best craftsmen are attracted to the largest cities, such as Altdorf, Marienburg and Nuln. There they can command high prices from the richest clientele, or work with Merchants who can sell their goods in more distant locales. Some Artisans are so famous that even Nobles must put their names on waiting lists, for to have the work of a renowned master is sign of status. The masterwork of an Artisan is truly something to behold.

Assassin,"Killing for money is not unusual in the Old World. Soldiers and Mercenaries do it every day. Few sell swords achieve the Assassin’s level of lethality, however. These hired killers are expertly trained and deadly with a variety of weapons. Many also master the poisoner’s art. The best Assassins can dispatch their targets in a matter of seconds, leaving behind no evidence of their presence. Their services are much sought after by political and even religious bodies. Few Assassins care where the commissions come from. They only want a challenging mission and a fat purse for their fee. While most Assassins are loners, a rare few have organized into guilds.","25,25,10,10,30,20,10,20","2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0","Concealment, Disguise, Gossip, Perception, Prepare Poison, Scale Sheer Surface, Secret Signs (Thief), Shadowing, Silent Move","Quick Draw, Lightning Parry, Sharpshooter, Specialist Weapon Group (Entangling), Specialist Weapon Group (Parrying), Specialist Weapon Group (Throwing), Street Fighting, Streetwise, Swashbuckler","Entries: Champion, Duellist, Judicial Champion, Outlaw Chief, Spy, Targeteer"," Champion, Outlaw Chief, Rogue, Sergeant, Witch Hunter"
Captain,"Captains are the war leaders of the strife- wracked Old World. They command Soldiers, Militiamen, Mercenaries and even Roadwardens, on bloody battlefields and corpse-strewn streets in the endless military campaigns of the Empire and beyond. Most Captains are tough professional Soldiers who have survived dozens of fierce battles to get where they are. It’s no surprise then that they resent having to serve under inexperienced Nobles, an all too common occurrence. Captains tend to respect experience and ability over birth and social position. They know what counts on the battlefield.","30,20,20,20,20,15,15,25","2,7,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (Strategy/ Tactics), Animal Care, Command, Common Knowledge (any three), Dodge Blow, Gossip, Read/Write, Ride, Secret Language (Battle Tongue), Speak Language (Kislevian or Tilean)","Disarm or Quick Draw, Lightning Parry, Specialist Weapon Group (Cavalry or Two-handed Weapon), Specialist Weapon Group (Flail or Parrying)","Explorer, Ghost Strider, Knight, Knight of the Inner Circle, Noble Lord, Outlaw Chief, Sergeant, Witch Hunter","Agitator, Explorer, Merchant, Outlaw Chief, Politician"
Cat Burglar,"Cat Burglars see themselves as a cut above the common thieves and footpads. They leave the slitting of both purses and throats to the gutter scum, preferring to steal with more finesse. The Cat Burglar’s art requires observation, planning, and impeccable timing. A well-executed theft may not even be detected for months, by which time the Cat Burglar is far away. Most Cat Burglars are members of a Thieves’ Guild, though some defy the odds and go it alone. Such lone wolves must elude both the law and the guild; a dangerous game to be sure.","10,10,5,5,25,10,10,0","0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Concealment, Evaluate, Gossip, Haggle, Perception, Pick Lock, Scale Sheer Surface, Search, Secret Language (Thieves’ Tongue), Secret Signs (Thief), Silent Move","Alley Cat, Street Fighting, Streetwise, Trapfinder","Bone Picker, Charlatan, Grave Robber, Rat Catcher, Thie","Crime Lord, Fence, Master Thief, Racketeer, Vagabond"
Champion,"Champions are warriors who dedicate their lives to martial combat, excelling as no others on the field of battle. They are not leaders of men, but as individual combatants they are peerless. They live for the moments when their skills are tested to the utmost, for only then do they truly know just how good they are. Many Champions serve in armies, warbands, and martial orders, though others wander the Empire, selling their formidable skills to the highest bidder. Their weapons are inevitably among the finest to be had in the Old World.","40,40,25,25,30,0,20,0","2,8,0,0,0,0,0,0","Dodge Blow, Evaluate, Intimidate, Perception","leet Footed or Lightning Reflexes, Lightning Parry, Master Gunner, Mighty Shot, Quick Draw, Rapid Reload, Specialist Weapon Group (any three), Wrestling","Assassin, Duellist, Judicial Champion, Knight of the Inner Circle, Targeteer, Veteran, Witch Hunter","Assassin, Scout, Sergeant, Witch Hunter"
Charlatan,"Charlatans are tricksters extraordinaire, cunning liars who can convince people of almost anything. With their glib tongues and ready wits they bilk the gullible out of their fortunes and escape with both the money and their lives. For a Charlatan, lying is like breathing. Common Charlatans are content to sell worthless miracle cures and trinkets that will supposedly ward off black magic whereas more skilled ones fake being other professions to collect consultation fees and sell off property that they don’t own. Legendary Charlatans run con schemes that try to take Nobles and rich Merchants for all they’re worth.","10,10,5,10,15,15,15,25","0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Blather, Charm, Common Knowledge (Bretonnia or Tilea), Disguise, Evaluate, Gamble, Gossip, Haggle, Perception, Secret Language (Thieves’ Tongue), Sleight of Hand, Speak Language (Breton or Tilean), Speak Language (Reikspiel)","Flee!, Mimic, Public Speaking, Schemer or Streetwise, Seasoned Traveller","Agitator, Camp Follower, Courtier, Entertainer, Envoy, Fence, Hedge Wizard, Journeyman Wizard, Minstrel, Rogue, Smuggler, Thie","Cat Burglar, Demagogue, Outlaw, Politician, Spy"
Courtier,"Courtiers surround the nobility at court, fawning over lieges and ladies in the hopes of getting ahead. They range from sycophants who desperately wish to please, to cunning schemers who seek the keys to wealth and prestige. Courtiers are frequently well-read and skilled public speakers, as they are often called upon to offer erudite opinions on a variety of subjects to their Noble patrons. No Courtier, no matter how clever, is ever fully secure in his position, as there is always another who desperately wants it and is willing to do nearly anything to get it. Female Courtiers are usually known as ladies-in-waiting.","5,5,0,0,10,20,20,20","0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (the Arts or History) or Gamble, Blather, Charm, Command or Performer (any one), Common Knowledge (Bretonnia or Tilea), Evaluate, Gossip, Perception, Read/Write, Ride, Speak Language (Breton or Tilean), Speak Language (Reikspiel)","Dealmaker or Etiquette, Public Speaking, Savvy or Suave, Schemer or Specialist Weapon Group (Fencing)","Noble, Herald, Pistolier, Politician","Charlatan, Duellist, Noble Lord, Politician, Steward, Spy"
Crime Lord,"Most cities of the Old World have one or more organized criminal organisations, such as Thieves’ or Assassins’ Guilds. Crime Lords are the leaders of these groups and they are powerful and dangerous folk. To be counted among their ranks one must be clever, ambitious and completely ruthless. Most claw their way up from the bottom, learning every dirty trick in the book as they ascend to power. Crime Lords can seldom afford the luxury of trust. They are experts at evaluating both people and situations to seek whatever advantage they can. Many Crime Lords become involved in local politics to further their power.","20,20,15,15,20,25,20,30","1,6,0,0,0,0,0,0","Charm, Command, Common Knowledge (the Empire), Dodge Blow, Evaluate, Gossip, Haggle, Intimidate, Perception, Secret Language (Thieves’ Tongue), Secret Signs (Thief), Torture","Dealmaker or Schemer, Menacing, Public Speaking, Resistance to Poison, Sixth Sense, Specialist Weapon Group (Crossbow or Parrying), Streetwise","Cat Burglar, Demagogue, Fence, Guild Master, Master Thief, Outlaw Chief, Politician, Steward","Demagogue, Master Thief, Outlaw Chief, Politician"
Daemon Slayer,"In every generation there are one or two Slayers who cannot seem to find the death they crave. At every turn, destiny cheats them or perhaps, drives them forward, and as the long years pass, they grow more and more fierce, determined to find the mighty doom that awaits them. When neither Trolls nor Giants can fell a Slayer, he takes on the mightiest foes of all: the Daemons of Chaos. Daemon Slayers are frightening individuals. They are barely sane at best, the shame of their continuing survival weighing ever on their thoughts, yet they’re also among the greatest warriors that the Old World has ever known.","40,0,30,30,20,0,30,0","2,8,0,0,0,0,0,0","Common Knowledge (any two), Consume Alcohol, Dodge Blow, Intimidate, Scale Sheer Surface","Lightning Parry, Unsettling", Giant Slayer,
Demagouge,"Demagogues are the most popular Agitators, public speakers so gifted that they can move countries with their persuasive words. They are always counted among the leaders of whatever cause they choose to champion. Those in power view Demagogues with a great deal of suspicion, as they are far too capable of stirring up dissent or sowing mistrust against the government or the church. If they can be properly directed however, they’re also very useful for rallying the people against Chaos and other threats. Thus the authorities treat popular Demagogues with caution and sometimes even favour.","10,10,0,10,15,20,15,30","1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (History), Academic Knowledge (Law), Blather, Charm, Command, Common Knowledge (the Empire), Concealment, Disguise, Dodge Blow, Gossip, Intimidate, Perception, Speak Language (Reikspiel)","Etiquette or Streetwise, Master Orator, Public Speaking, Street Fighting","Agitator, Anointed Priest, Artisan, Charlatan, Crime Lord, Flagellant, Friar, Initiate, Minstrel, Outlaw, Outlaw Chief, Politician, Rogue, Vampire Hunter, Witch Hunter","Crime Lord, Friar, Mercenary, Outlaw Chief, Politician"
Duelist,"A complex legal system of formal duels was established throughout the Empire ages ago. Duellists are specialists in the lethal application of sword and pistol, hiring themselves out to safeguard the honour of others, though many of their kind come from the ranks of younger Nobles who duel for their own purposes. Duellists come in two varieties: happy-go-lucky devil-may-care swashbucklers who regard their exploits as a continuous adventure, and deadly serious fighters who wear their honour on their sleeves and are very quick to take offence at slights, imagined or otherwise.","20,20,10,20,20,15,15,10","1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Charm, Dodge Blow, Gamble, Gossip, Intimidate, Perception, Sleight of Hand","Ambidextrous or Disarm, Etiquette, Master Gunner, Mighty Shot, Quick Draw, Sharpshooter, Specialist Weapon Group (Fencing), Specialist Weapon Group (Gunpowder), Specialist Weapon Group (Parrying), Strike Mighty Blow, Strike to Injure, Swashbuckler","Courtier, Estalian Diestro, Highwayman, Pistolier, Protagonist, Sergeant, Targeteer","Assassin, Champion, Highwayman, Rogue, Sergeant"
Engineer,"It was the Dwarfs who first introduced the science of engineering to the Old World. Among them, the Engineers’ Guild is deeply respected and its works are held in high esteem, so long as it upholds traditional methods and values. Humanity took what the Dwarfs had to offer and ran with it, especially in regards to gunpowder and other devices suitable for use as weapons. The Imperial School of Engineers in Altdorf is famed for its bizarre inventions, which can be most useful if they manage to function correctly. Outside the Empire, Tileans are particularly famed for their bold engineering ideas.","10,15,5,5,10,20,10,0","0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","cademic Knowledge (Engineering), Academic Knowledge (Science), Common Knowledge (Dwarfs or Tilea), Drive or Ride, Perception, Read/Write, Speak Language (Khazalid or Tilean), Trade (Gunsmith)","Master Gunner, Specialist Weapon Group (Engineer or Gunpowder)","Artisan, Miner, Student, Tradesman","Artisan, Explorer, Guild Master, Pistolier, Smuggler"
Explorer,"Explorers are afflicted by wanderlust and travel extensively across the Old World and beyond. They channel their great need to know what lies beyond the next horizon into finding new lands and new opportunities for trade. Explorers regularly delve into the unknown, which either turns them into canny fighters and diplomats or makes them very short-lived. They are skilled in travelling by both land and sea. Explorers tend to be highly capable individuals. The variety of roles they are called upon to assume forces them to become very flexible, able to command troops or negotiate in tongues they barely understand.","20,20,10,15,15,25,20,15","1,6,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (History or Law), Command, Common Knowledge (any three), Drive, Evaluate, Follow Trail, Navigation, Outdoor Survival, Perception, Read/Write, Ride, Scale Sheer Surface, Secret Language (Ranger Tongue), Secret Signs (Scout), Speak Language (any three), Swim, Trade (Cartographer)","Orientation or Linguistics, Seasoned Traveller","Captain, Engineer, Herald, Master Thief, Master Wizard, Mate, Navigator, Scholar, Scout, Sea Captain, Spy, Wizard Lord","Captain, Merchant, Sea Captain, Spy"
Fence,"The majority of Burghers and Tradesmen are willing to deal in goods of questionable legality. Such merchandise is the stock and trade of the Fence. They are experts at liquidating stolen goods. For a percentage of the profit, they take a thief ’s bounty and move it to another town, city, or even country where it can be more safely disposed of. Fences are experts at evaluating the worth of any given item and therefore exactly how hot it is likely to be. The greater the risk, the greater the cut they demand.","15,10,10,5,10,5,10,10","1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Evaluate, Gamble, Gossip, Haggle, Intimidate, Perception, Sleight of Hand","Dealmaker or Streetwise, Strike to Stun, Super

Flagellant,"Flagellants are crazed religious fanatics who barely care if they live or die, so long as they can strike a blow against Chaos and all that they perceive as vile before they go. They are often remarkablly charismatic individuals who lead other broken souls, as the force of their personality and their strong religious convictions draw others to them. Flagellants always wield massive weapons, the better to smite their enemies, and eschew the use of armour, feeling that their Gods will protect them until the proper time to die has come. Saner folk tend to actively avoid their company.","15,0,10,15,5,0,20,10","1,6,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (Theology), Charm, Heal, Intimidate, Speak Language (Classical)","Fearless, Specialist Weapon Group (Flail or Two- handed Weapon), Strike Mighty Blow","Anointed Priest, Friar, Priest, Zealo","Demagogue, Interrogator, Priest, Soldier, Veteran"
Friar,"Friars are mendicants who wander the Empire teaching religious virtue by example. Their orders date back to the time of Magnus the Pious. A Witch Hunter, Berndt of Wurtbad, was a particular foe of the cults of Slaanesh, the Chaos God of Sensuality and Pleasure. Berndt saw how decadence and lust lead inexorably to the embrace of Slaanesh. After years of blood and fire, Berndt laid aside his sword and torch, gave away his possessions, and began to walk the roads of the Empire preaching a message of poverty, chastity, and obedience. He wore nothing but a hair shirt and lived off the charity of the common folk. His fervent belief was that a humble life of poverty was the surest way to fight the insidious seduction of Chaos. The Order of St. Berndt was the first mendicant order of the Empire, though several others have sprung up since.

Ghost Strider,"Nearly supernaturally silent and fleet of foot, Ghost Striders roam over the Old World seeking out the forces of Chaos and various other threats to the natural world. They are most at home in the forest, though they can readily pass unseen over mountains and other terrain if need be. Ghost Striders are deadly archers, famed for never missing their targets. They are usually either softspoken or taciturn and considered to be both odd and intimidating, even by their own people. They are often more comfortable with the natural world than they are around other sentient beings.","20,30,15,15,25,20,20,0","2,6,0,0,0,0,0,0","Concealment, Dodge Blow, Follow Trail, Intimidate, Lip Reading, Navigation, Outdoor Survival, Perception, Secret Language (Ranger Tongue), Secret Signs (Ranger), Set Trap, Shadowing, Silent Move","Hardy or Fleet Footed, Lightning Parry, Mighty Shot, Quick Draw, Rapid Reload, Sure Shot",Scout,"Captain, Outlaw Chief, Targeteer, Vampire Hunter"
Giant Slayer,"There are many Troll Slayers who wish to find death, but secretly fear it. There are others, however, who are just too ferocious to readily die. These rare few become Giant Slayers: obsessed Dwarfs who have found that not even Trolls could offer a sufficient enough challenge to give them the glorious ending they crave. They continue to seek out combat and a proper death wherever they go, many of them becoming morose drinkers when they aren’t in the midst of battle. Giant Slayers continue to sport the spiky orange Slayer crest, but they tend to be covered with far more tattoos.","25,0,15,10,0,20,0","1,6,0,0,0,0,0,0","Common Knowledge (any one), Consume Alcohol, Dodge Blow, Intimidate, Perception","Fearless, Resistance to Poison, Specialist Weapon Group (Flail), Strike to Injure",Troll Slayer,Daemon Slayer
Guild Master,"Guild Masters are some of the most influential people in the Old World, quietly dictating how commerce is to work in various areas and facilitating the flow of trade. Among their ranks are master Merchants and calculating thieves, all of whom play a subtle game with the Nobles for power and control. Guild Masters are seldom great warriors, as they have many others at their beck and call to handle such things for them. Rather they are quasi-statesmen who deal with the Politicians of the Empire on their own terms. Depending on what guild they control, Guild Masters may be treated with the utmost respect or grudging civility.","10,10,0,10,15,30,20,35","1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (History), Charm, Command, Common Knowledge (the Empire), Evaluate, Gossip, Haggle, Perception, Secret Language (Guild Tongue), Speak Language (Breton, Estalian, Kislevian, or Norse), Speak Language (Reikspiel), Trade (any two)","Dealmaker, Etiquette, Linguistics","Artisan, Engineer, Merchant, Physician, Wizard Lord","Crime Lord, Politician, Racketeer"
Herald,"Heralds are the voices of the nobility, dutybound to announce the arrival of their lords and patrons, or who occasionally carry news of important events from afar. They are inevitably skilled speakers, swift wits, and greatly educated for the times. Heralds are expected to recognize the heraldry of hundreds of Nobles on sight, hence their namesake. They are seldom Nobles themselves, but their position is regarded as one of the few that acts as a stepping- stone into the ranks of the lesser nobility. Heralds pride themselves on their personal appearance, as it is a reflection upon whichever lord they serve.","10,10,5,5,15,15,10,20","0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (Genealogy/Heraldry), Academic Knowledge (History), Blather, Charm, Common Knowledge (Bretonnia, Kislev, or Tilea), Common Knowledge (the Empire), Evaluate, Gossip, Haggle, Perception, Read/Write, Ride, Speak Language (Breton, Kislevian, or Tilean), Speak Language (Reikspiel)","Etiquette, Master Orator, Public Speaking","Messenger, Valet","Agitator, Courtier, Entertainer, Explorer, Politician, Squire"
High Priest,"A High Priest is the living embodiment of his God’s will in the Old World. They are fairly rare, as few individuals have both the strength of character and the boundless faith it takes to reach such a lofty post. High Priests, with very few exceptions, will operate out of one of the primary centres of their faith. Pilgrims will travel the breadth of the Empire just to speak for a few moments with such a being. High Priests tend to either reject the physical world, retiring to a monastery or embrace the temporal, becoming powerful secular leaders.","20,20,15,15,15,20,30,25","1,6,0,0,0,3,0,0","Academic Knowledge (any three), Academic Knowledge (Theology), Channelling, Charm, Common Knowledge (any two), Gossip, Heal, Intimidate, Magical Sense, Ride or Swim, Speak Arcane Language (Magick), Speak Language (any three)","Aethyric Attunement or Meditation, Armoured Casting or Mighty Missile, Etiquette, Fast Hands or Strong-minded, Lesser Magic (any two",Anointed Priest,"Politician, Scholar, Witch Hunter"
Highwayman,"Highwaymen prey on the coaches that roam over the roads of the Old World, relieving lockboxes of their goods and passengers of their valuables. They affect the styles of the upper nobility, wearing elaborate masks and showing every point of etiquette to their victims, as they prefer to regard themselves as daring rogues rather than high-class Thieves. Highwaymen, by necessity, are skilled horsemen, adept at convincing their horses to race over uneven and treacherous ground at high speeds. They are also excellent shots, as they have to contend not only with swiftly moving targets, but a large number of dangerous forest denizens as well.","20,20,10,10,30,20,15,25","1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Animal Care, Animal Training, Charm, Common Knowledge (the Empire), Evaluate, Gossip, Ride, Silent Move","Ambidextrous, Etiquette, Master Gunner, Mighty Shot, Sharpshooter, Specialist Weapon Group (Fencing), Specialist Weapon Group (Gunpowder), Swashbuckler, Trick Riding","Coachman, Duellist, Estalian Diestro, Ferryman, Minstrel, Outlaw, Outrider, Roadwarden, Toll Keeper","Agitator, Duellist, Master Thief, Outlaw Chief, Sergeant"
Innkeeper,"Innkeepers own and run the establishments that allow the economy of the Old World to flourish. Many innkeeping families have owned their establishment for generations. They cater to all customers, regardless of social class, so long as they can pay. In a time when the majority of folk are insular, Innkeepers have learned information is valuable and they’re usually good for news from afar. A number of Innkeepers supplement their incomes by making introductions between customers. This varies from finding agreeable companionship for their guests to putting interested parties in contact with those who can permanently remove troublemakers with no questions asked","10,5,5,10,20,10,10,20","0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Blather or Lip Reading, Charm, Common Knowledge (the Empire), Consume Alcohol, Evaluate, Gossip, Haggle, Perception, Read/Write or Sleight of Hand, Speak Language (Breton, Kislevian, Reikspiel or Tilean), Trade (Cook)","Etiquette or Streetwise, Dealmaker or Street Fighting, Strike to Stun","Burgher, Servant","Burgher, Fence, Merchant, Outlaw, Smuggler"
Interrogator,"Interrogators know how to make people talk. They use both psychological and physical methods to extract information from their charges and neither is very pleasant. Interrogators work for Witch Hunters and Nobles and sometimes for the more zealous churches. They pride themselves on their efficiency, though many achieve it with excessive brutality. The best Interrogators know that discovering the truth is an art form. People lie and obfuscate and will say nearly anything to make the pain stop. Getting a confession is easy; getting to the truth is altogether more difficult.

Journeyman Wizard,"Human Journeymen Wizards have completed their apprenticeship and joined an Order of Wizardry. They now have access to all the spells of their chosen lore, but they must balance their newfound powers with their faltering ability to control them. The majority of Journeymen owe considerable teaching fees to their College, and must adventure to repay their debt. Journeymen Wizards hire out their services, often at their Orders’ request, for gold, knowledge and political betterment of their College. Elves, of course, are exempt from the College system, and owe nothing.","5,5,0,5,10,20,25,10","0,3,0,0,0,2,0,0","Academic Knowledge (Magic), Academic Knowledge (any one), Channelling, Charm or Intimidate, Common Knowledge (any two), Gossip, Magical Sense, Read/Write, Ride or Swim, Speak Arcane Language (Magick), Speak Language (any two)","Arcane Lore (any one) or Dark Lore (any one), Aethyric Attunement or Dark Magic, Fast Hands or Very Resilient, Lesser Magic (any two), Meditation or Mighty Missile",Apprentice Wizard,"Charlatan, Master Wizard, Scholar"
Judical Champion,"A number of Old World countries legally allow a defendant to proof his innocence via trial by combat. The accused are usually pitted against the local Judicial Champion, a professional fighter who specializes in defeating a single opponent swiftly and efficiently. Many of the laws that allow such combats state that specific weapons must be used; meaning Judicial Champions are well versed with a wide variety of arms. Correspondingly, Judicial Champions are both respected and feared warriors, whose prowess often precedes them. Noble defendants and the wealthy may sometimes be capable of hiring a Judicial Champion to fight in their place","35,0,15,20,10,15,0","2,6,0,0,0,0,0,0","Dodge Blow, Perception","Lightning Parry, Specialist Weapon Group (Fencing), Specialist Weapon Group (Flail), Specialist Weapon Group (Parrying), Specialist Weapon Group (Two-handed)","Sergeant, Veteran","Assassin, Champion, Sergeant, Witch Hunter, Zealot"
Knight,"Knights are professional Soldiers, generally, but not always of Noble blood. They specialize in fighting in heavy armour while using large weapons, often from horseback, and comprise a general’s most elite shock troops. Many Knights have a duty to protect the lower classes, though not all of them acknowledge it. There are a large number of knightly orders hailing from both the Empire and Bretonnia, such as the Knights of the White Wolf, the Knights Panther, the Reiksgard Knights, and the Grail Knights. Religious orders of Knights are known as templars.

Knight Of The inner Circle,"Within each knightly order there are those who rise to the top, the best of the best. They have proven themselves valiant and loyal time and time again and for that they are brought into the inner circle of the order. They command Knights in the field, represent the order at court, and make the important decisions. They are some of the greatest warriors the Old World has to offer and many of them have been entrusted with dangerous secrets about the foundations of their group. Each one of them aspires to become the Grand Master of his order. That is the pinnacle of knighthood.","35,10,20,20,20,15,25,15","2,8,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (Genealogy/Heraldry or Religion), Academic Knowledge (Strategy/Tactics), Animal Training, Charm, Command, Common Knowledge (any three), Dodge Blow, Perception, Read/ Write, Ride, Secret Language (Battle Tongue), Secret Signs (Scout or Templar), Speak Language (Breton, Estalian, Kislevian, or Tilean)","tiquette, Lightning Parry, Seasoned Traveller, Specialist Weapon Group (Fencing), Specialist Weapon Group (Parrying), Stout-hearted, Strike to Injure, Strike to Stun","Knight, Witch Hunter","Captain, Champion, Noble Lord, Witch Hunter"
Master Thief,"In every profession there are those who rise to the top. Master Thieves are the grand artistes of the criminal world. They are the best Thieves there are, proficient in all the skills that it takes to illegally acquire the goods of others. Master Thieves are usually a part of the local Thieves’ Guild structure, but as bravos who regularly flout the law, many of them are content to operate, ironically enough, “illegally”, e.g. without the approval of the local Crime Lord. The Empire has a long tradition of secretly admiring bold Thieves, though they will still be punished if caught.","20,20,10,10,40,25,20,25","1,6,0,0,0,0,0,0","Charm, Concealment, Disguise, Dodge Blow, Evaluate, Gamble or Lip Reading, Gossip, Perception, Pick Lock, Read/Write, Scale Sheer Surface, Secret Language (Thieves’ Tongue), Secret Signs (Thief), Search, Silent Move, Sleight of Hand, Swim","Specialist Weapon Group (Crossbow), Specialist Weapon Group (Throwing), Street Fighting or Swashbuckler, Streetwise, Trapfinder","Cat Burglar, Crime Lord, Fence, Highwayman, Racketeer, Spy","Crime Lord, Explorer, Outlaw Chief, Targeteer"
Master Wizard,"A Master Wizard is one who wields magic with surety and finesse. Elf Wizards find this level of spell casting easy to attain, but for a Human, it is a life’s work. By the time they reach this level of mastery, most Wizards begin to exhibit eccentricities and physical changes wrought by close association with magic. Master Wizards usually prefer to spend their time researching or politicking with fellow magisters. However, their Order usually requires them to adventure in the world at large, furthering the cause of their art, and seeking out young folk to apprentice.","10,10,0,10,15,30,35,15","0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0","Academic Knowledge (Magic), Academic Knowledge (any two), Channelling, Charm or Intimidate, Common Knowledge (any two), Gossip or Ride, Magical Sense, Read/Write, Speak Arcane Language (Magick), Speak Arcane Language (Daemonic or Arcane Elf), Speak Language (any three)","Aethyric Attunement or Meditation, Dark Magic or Strong-minded, Fast Hands or Mighty Missile, Lesser Magic (any two)",Journeyman Wizard,"Explorer, Scholar, Wizard Lord"
Mate,"Mates serve on ships as the second in command, answering directly to the Captain of the vessel. They are responsible for ensuring that the Captain’s orders are carried out, which can be a trying task with even the most professional of crews. Mates have to be stern but fair, earning the respect of their crew or they will swiftly find themselves the butt of many practical jokes and far worse if a mutiny should occur. Mates are always experienced sailors, often with several voyages under their belt and there are few ports they haven’t drank, fought, or caroused in.","15,15,10,15,10,10,10,10","1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Command, Common Knowledge (any two), Consume Alcohol, Dodge Blow, Gamble, Gossip, Intimidate, Row, Sail, Speak Language (Breton, Kislevian, or Norse), Swim, Trade (Shipwright)","Resistance to Disease, Seasoned Traveller, Street Fighting","Marine, Seaman","Explorer, Merchant, Navigator, Sea Captain"
Merchant,"Merchants are speculators who arrange to move large amounts of goods from city to city, seeking the market that they will make the most handsome profit in. They seldom interact with the populace as they deal in bulk, generally selling their goods to Burghers and Tradesmen. Merchant Guilds are extremely influential in the Empire and they are slowly usurping the position once held by Nobles in the Old World. Even the poorest Merchant tends to be very wealthy, indeed, many use their wealth to buy legitimacy, purchasing titles or marrying their children into Noble families.","10,10,5,5,10,25,20,20","0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Charm, Common Knowledge (any two), Drive, Evaluate, Gossip, Haggle, Read/Write, Ride, Secret Language (Guild Tongue), Speak Language (Breton, Estalian, Kislevian, or Norse), Speak Language (Reikspiel), Trade (Merchant)","Dealmaker or Streetwise, Super Numerate","Artisan, Burgher, Captain, Envoy, Explorer, Fisherman, Innkeeper, Mate, Scholar, Steward, Tradesman","Guild Master, Militiaman, Politician, Racketeer, Spy"
Minstrel,"Minstrels are wandering musicians who travel the roads of the Old World bringing their songs and entertainment to those who desperately need it. The original and most renowned Minstrels were Elves but now many Humans follow in their footsteps. Minstrels are close to sacred in the Old World. They can walk into some of the most dangerous dens of cutthroats and come out unscathed (as long as they’re willing to provide free entertainment, of course). Occasionally, a Minstrel will accept patronage from a Noble or Merchant and settle down for a time, composing songs at his patron’s request. Eventually, though, the open road calls and the Minstrel moves on again.

Navigator,"Navigators have the critically important task of getting a ship where it is supposed to go. Old World Navigators typically use charts to set their course, though they are often also capable of navigating by sun and stars. Navigators know the secrets of wind and tide, which makes them seem somewhat mystical to their sailor brethren and they are often regarded as a breed apart. Navigators are, by necessity, cartographers, charting the course of their voyages so that they may retrace them or that others may follow their route. As there are no compasses in the world, all ships employ a skilled Navigator, as do some overland expeditions.","10,10,5,5,10,25,10,5","0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (Astronomy), Common Knowledge (any two), Navigation, Perception, Read/ Write, Speak Language (Classical), Swim, Trade (Cartographer)",Orientation,"Boatman, Fisherman, Mate, Scribe, Seaman","Artisan, Explorer, Scholar, Sea Captain"
Noble Lord,"Noble Lords are members of the nobility with actual power and responsibility, unlike the many dilettantes who fill the courts of the Old World. Some inherit their positions, whereas others forcefully claw their way to them. All of them tend to be strong-willed, adroit public speakers, and skilled fighters. They must be adept at resolving local disputes, negotiating court politics, and leading troops in the field. Some of the most powerful Noble Lords in the Empire are the Elector Counts who choose from among their number who will be the next Emperor.","25,15,10,10,10,20,20,30","1,6,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (History or Strategy/Tactics), Academic Knowledge (Genealogy/Heraldry), Charm, Command, Common Knowledge (the Empire), Evaluate, Gossip, Perception, Read/Write, Ride, Speak Language (Classical), Speak Language (Reikspiel)","Master Orator, Public Speaking, Specialist Weapon Group (Fencing)","Courtier, Knight, Knight of the Inner Circle, Politician, Sea Captain","Captain, Knight, Scholar, Sea Captain"
Outlaw Chief,"Every band of brigands needs a leader. An Outlaw who shows he is both cunning and bold can rise to the level of Outlaw Chief. Commanding a lawless group of dangerous men is no easy task and the perilous forests of the Old World don’t make the job any easier. Outlaw Chiefs get their pick of the loot their band acquires, but they are also held responsible for every failure and their grasp on leadership is tenuous. Outlaw bands are notorious for not allowing any of their members to simply retire, which may make leaving the Chief ’s post a difficult task.","20,30,10,20,10,10,10,20","2,6,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (Strategy/Tactics), Command, Common Knowledge (the Empire), Concealment, Follow Trail, Perception, Ride, Scale Sheer Surface, Secret Language (Battle Tongue), Secret Language (Thieves’ Tongue), Secret Signs (Scout or Thief), Silent Move","Lightning Parry, Mighty Shot, Quick Draw, Rapid Reload, Sure Shot","Crime Lord, Demagogue, Ghost Strider, Highwayman, Master Thief, Racketeer, Scout, Veteran","Assassin, Captain, Crime Lord, Demagogue"
Physician,"Physicians are practitioners of the healing arts who study the mysteries of illness and anatomy. The science of medicine is relatively new and still distrusted by the majority of Old World citizens. Many regard unknown Physicians as either trumped up apothecaries or dangerous quacks until they’ve proven themselves. Skilled Physicians, however, are often well-respected members of their communities. They are capable of dealing with most minor ailments and a number of more straightforward injuries, such as major cuts or crushing wounds. Physicians are often eager to seek out new medicines and learn about more effective treatments.","0,0,10,10,15,30,20,15","0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (Science), Heal, Gossip, Perception, Prepare Poison, Read/Write, Speak Language (Classical), Trade (Apothecary","Resistance to Disease, Strike to Stun, Surgery","Barber-Surgeon, Interrogator, Scholar, Student","Friar, Guild Master, Scholar, Spy"
Pistolier,"Pistoliers are the elite light cavalry of the Imperial Army. They specialize in wielding firearms, specifically pistols. Pistoliers have only come into their own recently, as gunpowder weapons have been relatively unstable until now in the Old World. Because of the expense of their weapons and the constant upkeep that pistols and warhorses require, Noblemen dominate the ranks of the Pistoliers. Many young Nobles volunteer for the Pistoliers in search of glory or in the hopes of making a name.

Politician,"While the Nobles are nominally “in charge” of most of the Old World’s countries, it is the Politicians who actually run the villages, towns, and cities of the Empire. They are an often reviled and frequently corruptible lot whose ranks include burgomeisters, mayors, and other civil servants. Some are elected to their positions, while others are appointed. Politicians frequently find themselves between various dangerous factions and have to swiftly become skilled at the fine art of compromise. They are experts at saying exactly what people want to hear, though if they actually follow through on their promises, it’s a minor miracle","5,5,5,10,0,20,10,20","0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (History or Genealogy/Heraldry), Academic Knowledge (Law), Blather, Charm, Command, Common Knowledge (the Empire), Evaluate, Gossip, Haggle, Perception, Performer (Actor), Read/Write, Speak Language (Reikspiel)","Dealmaker or Schemer, Etiquette or Streetwise, Master Orator, Public Speaking","Agitator, Bailiff, Captain, Charlatan, Courtier, Crime Lord, Demagogue, Guild Master, Herald, High Priest, Merchant, Noble, Peasant, Racketeer, Toll Keeper","Courtier, Crime Lord, Demagogue, Noble Lord, Racketeer, Steward"
Priest,"Priests are ordained men and women who administer to the needs of the faithful throughout the Old World. Their Gods gift them with the ability to channel small amounts of divine energy, to aid in their works. Many Priests will be assigned to a specific region or church, others are wanderers who go where they feel they can do the most good. The receptions they get are directly linked to their deity. A Priestess of Shallya is likely to be received warmly no matter where she goes, whereas a Priest of Ulric is likely to only be heartily welcomed when a great battle is in the offing.","10,10,5,10,5,10,20,15","0,4,0,0,0,1,0,0","Academic Knowledge (any one), Academic Knowledge (Theology), Channelling, Charm, Common Knowledge (any two), Gossip, Heal, Magical Sense, Perception, Read/Write, Ride or Swim, Speak Arcane Language (Magick), Speak Language (any two)","Armoured Caster or Master Orator, Petty Magic (Divine), Strike to Injure or Strike to Stun","Flagellant, Friar, Initiate","Anointed Priest, Flagellant, Scholar, Steward"
Racketeer,"Racketeers make up the general ranks of most criminal organisations. They are experts at extorting protection money from small businesses, which tends to be their most lucrative operation. Successful Racketeers move into such activities as loan sharking, drug pedalling, prostitution and illegal gambling dens. They are seldom very imaginative, insofar as criminals go, but they are generally ruthless and used to having their own way. Racketeers are sometimes even a part of the local government, which makes rooting them out a very tricky business for law enforcement. In some areas, they are the local law enforcement.","20,15,15,10,10,0,15,10","1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0","Command, Common Knowledge (the Empire), Dodge Blow, Evaluate, Gossip, Haggle, Intimidate, Perception, Shadowing","Menacing, Street Fighting, Streetwise, Strike Mighty Blow, Strike to Stun","Bailiff, Bodyguard, Cat Burglar, Fence, Guild Master, Interrogator, Merchant, Politician, Protagonist, Spy, Thug","Fence, Master Thief, Politician, Outlaw Chief"
Scholar,"Scholars are academicians who have dedicated their lives to the pursuit of knowledge. Scholars include sages who delve into philosophy and scientific theory, monks who specialize in religious lore, and tutors who strive to educate the children of wealthy Merchants and Nobles. Some Scholars are driven to pursue esoteric or forbidden knowledge. Such a path requires great mental fortitude and a willingness to risk discovery by Witch Hunters and other Zealots. Those that actively study and pursue the law, such as clerks and lawyers, are considered to be a specialized form of Scholar in the Old World.","5,5,5,5,10,30,15,15","0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (any three), Common Knowledge (any three), Evaluate or Trade (Cartographer), Perception, Read/Write, Speak Language (any three), Speak Language (Classical)",Linguistics,"Anointed Priest, Apprentice Wizard, Friar, High Priest, Journeyman Wizard, Master Wizard, Navigator, Noble Lord, Physician, Priest, Scribe, Sea Captain, Student","Apprentice Wizard, Explorer, Friar, Merchant, Physician, Steward"
Scout,"Scouts are rare individuals who are more at home in the wild than in the teeming cities of the Old World. They roam through the wilderness, following trails that few other eyes can discern, while keeping an eye out for dangerous beasts and unnatural occurrences. Scouts are often more comfortable with animals than other people. They frequently hire their expertise out to armies, Merchants, and travellers who need to go far off the known roads. They usually roam ahead of their clients, seeking out ambushes and other troubles that may beset a large group on the move.","20,20,10,10,15,20,15,0","1,6,0,0,0,0,0,0","Animal Care, Common Knowledge (any two), Concealment, Dodge Blow, Follow Trail, Navigation, Perception, Ride, Secret Language (Ranger Tongue), Secret Signs (Scout), Silent Move, Speak Language (any two)","Charm Animal, Mighty Shot or Sure Shot, Orientation, Rapid Reload, Specialist Weapon (Crossbow or Longbow","Bounty Hunter, Champion, Charcoal-Burner, Coachman, Fieldwarden, Hunter, Kithband Warrior, Messenger, Miner, Outrider, Roadwarden, Runebearer, Vagabond, Woodsman","Explorer, Outlaw Chief, Sergeant, Vampire Hunter, Ghost Strider"
Sea Captain,"Sea Captains roam the oceans of the Old World seeking profit and adventure over the next horizon. Strictly honourable Sea Captains are far-travelling traders who only sail in search of the most profitable markets for their goods. The most dangerous are bloodthirsty pirates, attacking other ships for plunder and leaving no survivors. Most Sea Captains fall somewhere in between. On a sea-going vessel a Captain’s word is law. Sailors, however, are a fractious lot; a Sea Captain must be clever, strong-willed and a bit ruthless to stay in command. The most famous Sea Captains come from Marienburg, Tilea, and the Elven island of Ulthuan.

Sergeant,"Sergeants are professional warriors who’ve managed to impress either a Captain or a Noble with their ability to command men in battle. They lead small units of Soldiers, Militiamen, Mercenaries and Roadwardens, ensuring that orders are carried out to the letter. Some lead by setting a sterling example, others by terrifying their troops into quick obedience. Those who make their troopers lives a priority tend to be the most popular. The best Sergeants earn the respect of their Soldiers with their own blood and courage. They are often called upon to lead their men into danger and they swiftly become experts at assessing the capabilities of others.","20,15,10,10,10,10,10,20","1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (Strategy/Tactics), Command, Common Knowledge (any two), Dodge Blow, Gossip, Intimidate, Perception, Ride or Swim, Secret Language (Battle Tongue), Speak Language (Tilean)","Menacing or Seasoned Traveller, Street Fighting or Wrestling, Strike Mighty Blow, Strike to Stun","Assassin, Champion, Duellist, Highwayman, Judicial Champion, Kislevite Kossar, Marine, Mercenary, Militiaman, Norse Berserker, Pistolier, Roadwarden, Scout, Shieldbreaker, Soldier, Squire, Targeteer, Veteran, Watchman","Captain, Duellist, Judicial Champion, Knigh"
Spy,"Spies are secret agents who gather information for their patrons or the highest bidder. Spies are masters of disguise who often risk their lives to work undercover in enemy territory. Some will even join subversive groups and study them for months from the inside. A Spy who dares to infiltrate a Chaos coven risks far worse than death, but there are many groups in the Old World who desperately need the information such a stout soul can provide. All the nations of the Old World employ Spies, usually to monitor the military and political moves of their rivals.","15,15,5,10,20,20,35,20","1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Charm, Common Knowledge (any two), Concealment, Disguise, Gossip, Lip Reading, Performer (Actor), Pick Lock, Shadowing, Sleight of Hand, Secret Language (any one), Silent Move, Speak Language (any three)","Flee!, Linguistics, Schemer, Suave or Sixth Sense","Camp Follower, Charlatan, Courtier, Explorer, Merchant, Minstrel, Physician, Sea Captain, Servant","Assassin, Explorer, Master Thief, Racketeer"
Steward,"A Steward is a household manager, entrusted with arranging all the bothersome everyday details that Nobles and the very rich, such as successful Merchants or powerful clergy, cannot be bothered to deal with. While a Noble Lord will often have no idea what he is worth or how much it takes to upkeep his affairs and various holdings, his Steward will know down to the last shilling. As wealthy Nobles tend to have far flung estates, some Stewards may be put in charge of a property and left to their own devices for years at a time","10,10,10,10,0,30,20,25","0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (Law), Charm, Command, Common Knowledge (the Empire), Evaluate, Gossip, Haggle, Intimidate, Perception, Read/Write, Ride, Search, Speak Language (Reikspiel), Trade (Merchant)","Public Speaking, Super Numerate","Courtier, Politician, Priest, Scholar, Valet","Crime Lord, Fence, Merchant, Noble"
Targeteer,"Targeteers dedicate themselves to perfecting their skill with missile weapons, most often the mighty longbow, though a rare few prefer the crossbow. They regularly travel to different fairs, delighting crowds with their trick shooting and pitting their skills against all-comers in impromptu contests. Many Nobles regularly hold archery tourneys with a fair purse to the winner and a professional Targeteer can make a decent living if he is skilled enough to regularly claim a prize or two. In these grim times, a Targeteer’s uncanny skill with a bow is in high demand among armies and Mercenary companies.","0,35,10,10,25,10,20,15","1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Common Knowledge (the Empire), Gossip, Outdoor Survival, Perception, Search, Sleight of Hand","Mighty Shot, Rapid Reload, Sharpshooter, Specialist Weapon Group (Longbow), Specialist Weapon Group (Crossbow or Throwing), Sure Shot","Bounty Hunter, Hunter, Ghost Strider, Master Thief, Vampire Hunter, Veteran","Assassin, Champion, Duellist, Sergeant"
Vampire Hunter,"Vampire Hunters are driven souls who seek to destroy the Undead by any means necessary. Many of them have lost friends and family members to the Restless Dead, most often to their namesake. Since any but the most cursory knowledge of the Undead is a forbidden subject in the Empire, Vampire Hunters are a self-made lot. They congregate quietly with others of their ilk; sharing what little knowledge they’ve gleaned from their more successful encounters with the forces of the Restless Dead in hopes of one day finding a sure method of killing vampires.","20,20,10,20,15,15,20,0","1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (History or Necromancy), Common Knowledge (the Empire), Concealment, Dodge Blow, Follow Trail, Perception, Scale Sheer Surface, Shadowing, Search, Silent Move, Speak Language (Classical)","Mighty Shot or Rapid Reload, Specialist Weapon Group (Crossbow), Stout-hearted, Strike Mighty Blow, Strike to Injure, Tunnel Rat","Bounty Hunter, Field Warden, Ghost Strider, Knight, Scout, Tomb Robber","Demagogue, Initiate, Knight, Targeteer, Witch Hunter"
Veteran,"A professional Soldier or Mercenary who survives a great many battles, but cares not in the slightest for rising up the ranks, eventually finds himself a Veteran. Veterans are, first and foremost, survivors. They don’t volunteer for suicide missions and they don’t take unnecessary risks, but when the time comes to get stuck in, they’re some of the toughest troops on the field. Off-duty Veterans are always good for old war tales. They carouse with a will, knowing that their time may be short and there’s no sense in dying with gold still in your pockets.","20,20,10,10,15,0,15,0","1,6,0,0,0,0,0,0","Common Knowledge (the Empire), Consume Alcohol, Dodge Blow, Gamble, Gossip, Intimidate, Perception, Secret Language (Battle Tongue)","Mighty Shot or Strike Mighty Blow, Rapid Reload or Strike to Injure, Specialist Weapon Group (any two), Very Resilient or Very Strong","Flagellant, Kislevite Kossar, Kithband Warrior, Mercenary, Norse Berserker, Outlaw, Pistolier, Pit Fighter, Runebearer, Shieldbreaker, Soldier, Squire","Champion, Judicial Champion, Outlaw Chief, Sergeant, Targeteer"
Witch Hunter,"Witch Hunters are grim individuals who have dedicated their lives to eradicating the forces of Chaos, either in the service of the state or the Church of Sigmar. They prefer to seek out Chaos cultists, Mutants, and heretics that have insidiously hidden amidst the cities of the Empire. However, they will travel far indeed if they think they can strike a meaningful blow against the forces of evil. Witch Hunters tend to be a surly and suspicious lot with no qualms about killing innocents, so long as they also manage to slay the guilty, which means their appearance is often regarded with dread by other folk.","30,30,15,15,15,15,35,20","2,6,0,0,0,0,0,0","Academic Knowledge (Magic), Academic Knowledge (Necromancy), Academic Knowledge (Theology), Charm, Command, Common Knowledge (the Empire), Gossip, Intimidate, Perception, Ride, Search, Silent Move, Speak Language (any one)","Lightning Parry, Lightning Reflexes or Marksman, Menacing, Public Speaking, Sixth Sense, Specialist Weapon Group (Crossbow), Specialist Weapon Group (Entangling), Specialist Weapon Group (Throwing), Stout-hearted, Strike Mighty Blow","Anointed Priest, Assassin, Champion, High Priest, Judicial Champion, Knight of the Inner Circle, Vampire Hunter","Captain, Champion, Demagogue, Initiate, Knight of the Inner Circle"
Wizard Lord,"Within the Empire, the Lords of the Magical Orders are powerful individuals indeed. They no longer see the world as others do, however, having dedicated their very souls to magic. They now embody their chosen Lore in word, deed and physical form. Should an Elf attain this level of magical skill, he is considered to have completed his minor magic apprenticeship, and is ready to travel to the towers of Hoeth to become a High Mage.","15,15,5,15,20,35,40,20","0,5,0,0,0,4,0,0","Academic Knowledge (Magic), Academic Knowledge (any three), Channelling, Charm or Intimidate, Common Knowledge (any three), Magical Sense, Read/Write, Speak Arcane Language (Magick), Speak Arcane Language (Daemonic or Arcane Elf), Speak Language (any four)","Aethyric Attunement or Mighty Missile, Dark Magic or Meditation, Fast Hands or Hardy, Lesser Magic (any two)",Master Wizard,"Explorer, Guild Master"
